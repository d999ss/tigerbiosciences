# Reframe Partnerships to avoid implied endorsements

Labels: high

Problem
Logos under "Partners" may imply current endorsements; "FDA" shouldn't appear as a partner.

Acceptance Criteria
- Partnerships copy reframed to collaboration language.
- Only logos with current contractual usage rights shown.
- Regulatory badges moved to Quality & Compliance.

Implementation Notes
- Use new Partnerships copy; add CMS flag { allowed: boolean }.
